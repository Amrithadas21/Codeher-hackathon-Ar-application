Augmented Reality Dementia Support Tool
This repository contains an Augmented Reality (AR) application developed using Unity and Vuforia Engine, with C# as the primary scripting language. The tool is designed as a basic support system for dementia patients experiencing semantic memory loss. It enables patients to recall significant people in their lives by displaying videos of loved ones when scanning familiar objects using AR.This was team project


ðŸ”¹ Download the APK
Due to file size limitations, the APK is hosted on Google Drive.

ðŸ”¹ Installation Instructions:

1)Download the APK from the link above.

2)Allow installation from unknown sources in device settings.

3)Install and launch the app to start using the AR experience.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
Object Recognition with Vuforia: Uses Vuforia Image Targeting to recognize objects and trigger relevant videos.
Video Playback in AR: Once an object is scanned, a pre-linked video of a loved one appears, offering personalized memory reinforcement.
User-Friendly UI: Simple interaction and intuitive controls make it accessible for dementia patients.
Optimized for Mobile Devices: Works on Android & iOS, making it easy for caregivers to implement.
ðŸ”¹ Technical Details
1. Tools & Frameworks Used
Unity 3D (Primary development environment)

2.Vuforia Engine (For AR tracking and object recognition)
C# (For scripting AR interactions and video playback logic)

3. Implementation Flow
Object Recognition:

Uses Vuforia Image Target to detect pre-defined objects.
Each object is mapped to a corresponding video file stored in the application.
Video Display & Playback:

Unity VideoPlayer component is used to load and play the associated video.
Videos appear as floating UI panels in the AR space.
Memory Reinforcement Mechanism:

The patient interacts with familiar objects in their environment.
Once scanned, the video of a family member or loved one plays, helping them recall relationships.
3. Key Unity Components Used
ARCamera (Handles Vuforia tracking)
ImageTarget (Recognizes objects linked to videos)
VideoPlayer Component (Plays stored videos on scan)
UI Canvas (Displays the video interface)

ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements
Support for voice-based memory recall
Integration with cloud storage for dynamically updating videos
Implementing gesture-based interactions for ease of use
This project aims to make cognitive assistance more accessible for individuals with dementia, helping them reconnect with their memories through immersive AR experiences. ðŸš€
